# The Art of Network Penetration Testing

After the second time around of reading this book, I must say I learned so much beyond just
what to do on an engagement. If you ever coached, played, or taught a sport you can contest
that it’s more preferable to train someone who has never been taught then someone who was
taught bad habits. So for everyone who is trying to get into pentesting I would highly
recommend this book. The overall process from start to finish, the relatable Hollywood storyline,
jam packed with details that range from techniques, organizational skills, attack philosophy,
report writing, cleanup, and so much more. There are very few if any books in this space out
there that I have read that incorporate technical, theoretical, practical, and soft skills all in one.

Royce masterfully layouts his vision to manifest the workflow of a real life Internal Network
Penetration Test (INPT). Broken down into four key phases which are consecutive in nature.
Packaged with an active lab environment to compliment the entire experience which will
encapsulate the reader and have him or her feeling as if they are on an actual engagement.
Material densely packed, yet far from dry, in fact if you're a fan of hollywood heist movies you
will enjoy the delightful pairing of imagination with the adversarial attack simulation process. In
short, if pentesting is something you want to get into, or just curious about. I highly recommend
checking out Royce’s book. You will not be disappointed, and if you are a hacker/nerd like
myself, pro tip don’t forget to check out the appendices.
